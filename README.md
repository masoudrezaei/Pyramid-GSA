###  Abstract
Genetics play a prominent role in the development and progression of malignant neoplasms. Identification of the relevant genes is a high-dimensional data processing obstacle. A novel hybrid method in which the number of genes is cyclically reduced is proposed to conquer the curse of dimensionality.  The proposed method consists of a filter based method in the first step followed by the pyramid gravitational search algorithm at the second step. The genes selected in the first step are passed on to the next one.  Pyramid GSA selects the most related genes which provide the best classification accuracy during several cycles in which the number of genes per cycle are pyramidically decreased. The relationship between selected genes and patient prognosis using network analysis are examined. The evaluation results are reported on a gene expression dataset for breast cancer patients. In the dataset, there are six classes of patients with distinctive prognoses. Several feature selection algorithms are used for comparison. The pyramid GSA could reach 90% accuracy with less than 100 genes. An interesting pattern was emerged when examining the gene-gene interaction network results. This pattern shows the most crucial bottleneck genes related to tumor suppression, inflammation pathways and patients' survival.
